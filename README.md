# FCFS Scheduling Calculator

The FCFS Scheduling Calculator is a web-based application designed to simulate and analyze First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) process scheduling in operating systems. This tool provides a clear visualization of process execution based on their arrival times, making it an excellent resource for learning and experimentation.

## Features

- **Process Simulation**: Visualize the execution order of processes based on FCFS scheduling.
- **Interactive Input**: Add, edit, and remove processes with ease.
- **Gantt Chart Visualization**: View a graphical representation of process execution timelines.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate and display key metrics such as average waiting time and turnaround time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Implements the core scheduling algorithm and backend logic.
- **Flask**: Powers the web application framework for seamless interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structures and styles the user interface for an intuitive experience.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances interactivity and dynamic functionality.
- **Bootstrap**: Delivers responsive and modern UI components.
- **SQLite**: Manages persistent storage of process data efficiently.
